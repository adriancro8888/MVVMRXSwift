# MVVMRXSwift
Small Demo App using MVVM and RXSwift

This app is simple demo of using RxSwift with MVVM Pattern. And it shows how easy is to communicate both directions using RXSwift. 

This App shows how we can enable/disable the button state based on the validation of the textfields present on the screen. With very minimal code we can acheive this functionality by using RxSwift.
